  'slide-up-delayed': 'slideUp 0.7s ease-out 0.2s both',
  'progress-grow': 'progressGrow 1.2s ease-out 0.3s both',
  'progress-shimmer': 'progressShimmer 2s infinite linear',
  'number-count': 'numberCount 0.8s ease-out 0.4s both',
}
```

### Custom Keyframes:
- Smooth entry animations
- Staggered timing for cinematic effect
- Realistic progress animations
